To play you need an opponent. Game ties two last connections together.

Menu controls: 1,2 to chose options, letter keys to write.

1. Reg in game

In game controls: WASD - change orientation of your tank, arrow keys - move your tank, SPACE - shoot, R - starts new map with the same opponent (both of opponents need to press R, you can check if it pressed in right bottom of screen)
